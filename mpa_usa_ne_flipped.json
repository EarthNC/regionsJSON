The biological features of Botany Bay Plantation WMA are characteristic of Sea Islands along the lower Southeast coast. The undeveloped coastal habitats of the management area are important to numerous wildlife species. The beach is utilized for nesting by the federally-threatened loggerhead sea turtle and the state-threatened least tern. The maritime forest and coastal scrub\/shrub areas provide nesting and foraging habitat for neotropical songbirds including painted buntings and summer tanagers.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>Check the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dnr.sc.gov\/news.html\" target=\"_blank\">News Releases<\/a>.

Fish and invertebrate populations subject to seasonal and migration shifts include both demersal and pelagic species, such as bluefin tuna, herring, cod, flounders, lobster, and scallops. Endangered leatherback and Kemp's ridley sea turtles use the area for feeding.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For the latest news and events, visit the NOAA website for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\">Greater Atlantic Region<\/a>.

Shoe Island (one acre), Pismire Island (two acres), and Scarecrow Island (seven acres) were the first to be acquired in 1947 and were designated as Federal Wilderness Areas in 1970. Thunder Bay Island (218 acres) and Gull Island (230 acres) were acquired from the U.S. Coast Guard in the 1960s. Hat Island (11 acres) was procured from The Nature Conservancy in 1994. In 1943, during World War II, Hat Island was bombed for target practice by the U.S. Navy. At that time, Hat Island was burned and partially covered in tar reducing its vegetation, but once left to natural processes, trees, other vegetation, and wildlife eventually returned. Big and Little Charity were acquired in 1999 through a Natural Resources Damage Assessment agreement with the General Motors Corporation. During the 1600s, the Charity Islands were used as an overnight stopping point by early French explorers such as Jean Nicolet and Robert de LaSalle and have been a refuge for boaters stranded during storms on Lake Huron. The most recent island added to the refuge is Sugar Island (143 acres), which was acquired from The Nature Conservancy in 2010.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For the latest updates, consult the Michigan Department of Fish and Game <a href=\"https:\/\/www.michigan.gov\/dnr\/0,4570,7-153-10364_63235---,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" >Website<\/a>.

Shoe Island (one acre), Pismire Island (two acres), and Scarecrow Island (seven acres) were the first to be acquired in 1947 and were designated as Federal Wilderness Areas in 1970. Thunder Bay Island (218 acres) and Gull Island (230 acres) were acquired from the U.S. Coast Guard in the 1960s. Hat Island (11 acres) was procured from The Nature Conservancy in 1994. In 1943, during World War II, Hat Island was bombed for target practice by the U.S. Navy. At that time, Hat Island was burned and partially covered in tar reducing its vegetation, but once left to natural processes, trees, other vegetation, and wildlife eventually returned. Big and Little Charity were acquired in 1999 through a Natural Resources Damage Assessment agreement with the General Motors Corporation. During the 1600s, the Charity Islands were used as an overnight stopping point by early French explorers such as Jean Nicolet and Robert de LaSalle and have been a refuge for boaters stranded during storms on Lake Huron. The most recent island added to the refuge is Sugar Island (143 acres), which was acquired from The Nature Conservancy in 2010.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For the latest updates, consult the Michigan Department of Fish and Game <a href=\"https:\/\/www.michigan.gov\/dnr\/0,4570,7-153-10364_63235---,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" >Website<\/a>.

Shoe Island (one acre), Pismire Island (two acres), and Scarecrow Island (seven acres) were the first to be acquired in 1947 and were designated as Federal Wilderness Areas in 1970. Thunder Bay Island (218 acres) and Gull Island (230 acres) were acquired from the U.S. Coast Guard in the 1960s. Hat Island (11 acres) was procured from The Nature Conservancy in 1994. In 1943, during World War II, Hat Island was bombed for target practice by the U.S. Navy. At that time, Hat Island was burned and partially covered in tar reducing its vegetation, but once left to natural processes, trees, other vegetation, and wildlife eventually returned. Big and Little Charity were acquired in 1999 through a Natural Resources Damage Assessment agreement with the General Motors Corporation. During the 1600s, the Charity Islands were used as an overnight stopping point by early French explorers such as Jean Nicolet and Robert de LaSalle and have been a refuge for boaters stranded during storms on Lake Huron. The most recent island added to the refuge is Sugar Island (143 acres), which was acquired from The Nature Conservancy in 2010.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For the latest updates, consult the Michigan Department of Fish and Game <a href=\"https:\/\/www.michigan.gov\/dnr\/0,4570,7-153-10364_63235---,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" >Website<\/a>.

During the 1600s, the Charity Islands were used as an overnight stopping point by early French explorers such as Jean Nicolet and Robert de LaSalle and have been a refuge for boaters stranded during storms on Lake Huron. The most recent island added to the refuge is Sugar Island (143 acres), which was acquired from The Nature Conservancy in 2010.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For the latest updates, consult the Michigan Department of Fish and Game <a href=\"https:\/\/www.michigan.gov\/dnr\/0,4570,7-153-10364_63235---,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" >Website<\/a>.
