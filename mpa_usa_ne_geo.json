Botany Bay Plantation WMA with Botany Bay Island (under conservation easement with The Nature Conservancy) and Deveaux Bank form a core area of protected habitat in the eastern corner of the Focus Area. The biological features of Botany Bay Plantation WMA are characteristic of Sea Islands along the lower Southeast coast. The undeveloped coastal habitats of the management area are important to numerous wildlife species. The beach is utilized for nesting by the federally-threatened loggerhead sea turtle and the state-threatened least tern. The maritime forest and coastal scrub\/shrub areas provide nesting and foraging habitat for neotropical songbirds including painted buntings and summer tanagers.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>Check the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dnr.sc.gov\/news.html\" target=\"_blank\">News Releases<\/a>.

Within the Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary there are rocky ledges with sponge and coral live bottom communities, as well as sandy bottom areas that are more typical of the seafloor off the southeastern U.S. coast.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>Check NOAA's <a href=\"https:\/\/sero.nmfs.noaa.gov\/fishery_bulletins\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fishery Bulletins<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/sero.nmfs.noaa.gov\/news_room\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">News Room<\/a>.<\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Call the U.S. Coast Guard stations in Brunswick 912-267-7999 or Tybee Island 912-786-5440; or call NOAA\u2019s toll-free, 24-hour Fisheries Enforcement hotline 800-853-1964<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>"},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-80.828147,31.36274],[-80.921203,31.36274],[-80.921203,31.384449],[-80.921203,31.42107],[-80.828147,31.42107],[-80.828147,31.384449],[-80.828147,31.36274]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"21205","type":"SMA","name":"Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary Research Area","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"33FF0000","lineColor":"FFFF0000","information":"<b>No Take Area<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> NOAA National Marine Sanctuary Program<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>In addition to the prohibitions applicable throughout the Sanctuary, the following activities are prohibited:<br>1.

These rich areas of aquatic growth began declining in the 1960's due to several factors. Due to the sharp decrease in waterfowl population and vegetation in the area, the presidential proclamations which originally closed the water areas were lifted on September 1, 1978 and returned to Maryland for supervision.

rearing for black ducks and other wildbirds. The refuge and surrounding areas were once covered with wild celery, pond weeds, redhead grass and other desirable waterfowl food sources.  At their peak, waterfowl included over 500,000 canvasback and redhead ducks as well as over 200,000 American wigeon.  These rich areas of aquatic growth began declining in the 1960's due to several factors. Due to the sharp decrease in waterfowl population and vegetation in the area, the presidential proclamations which originally closed the water areas were lifted on September 1, 1978 and returned to Maryland for supervision.  Battery Island in Maryland remains a part of the NWR System. <\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>Please visit the MD DNR Fisheries Service Public Notices <a

As a result, many species have returned to islands where they nested historically.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>To report injured wildlife or violations of wildlife laws call the refuge headquarters at (207) 594-0600<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>"},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-67.944808,44.400585],[-67.944893,44.40041],[-67.944871,44.400343],[-67.944661,44.400332],[-67.94458,44.400307],[-67.944466,44.40018],[-67.944526,44.400055],[-67.944703,44.399973],[-67.945006,44.399951],[-67.945263,44.399954],[-67.945472,44.399989],[-67.945565,44.399981],[-67.94538,44.399896],[-67.945265,44.399828],[-67.944975,44.399742],[-67.944604,44.399638],[-67.944176,44.399459],[-67.943945,44.39934],[-67.943655,44.399212],[-67.943402,44.399059],[-67.943289,44.398874],[-67.943199,44.398664],[-67.943248,44.398523],[-67.943483,44.398424],[-67.94381,44.398419],[-67.944123,44.39848],[-67.944448,44.398584],[-67.944841,44.398746],[-67.945096,44.398857],[-67.945361,44.399018],[-67.94558,44.399171],[-67.945846,44.399274],[-67.946103,44.399218],[-67.94629,44.399194],[-67.946698,44.39924],[-67.946859,44.399333],[-67.946926,44.399484],[-67.946866,44.399584],[-67.946714,44.399616],[-67.946482,44.399564],[-67.946319,44.399571],[-67.946294,44.399654],[-67.946468,44.399706],[-67.946466,44.399823],[-67.946475,44.399923],[-67.946579,44.400024],[-67.946729,44.400092],[-67.946868,44.400144],[-67.94696,44.400203],[-67.947122,44.400288],[-67.947215,44.400314],[-67.947307,44.400382],[-67.94755,44.400443],[-67.947737,44.400419],[-67.947901,44.400413],[-67.947946,44.400471],[-67.94792,44.400613],[-67.947918,44.400722],[-67.948021,44.400865],[-67.94803,44.40099],[-67.948143,44.401175],[-67.948246,44.40131],[-67.948335,44.401528],[-67.948287,44.401645],[-67.948099,44.401718],[-67.947853,44.401774],[-67.947666,44.401806],[-67.947443,44.401879],[-67.947266,44.40197],[-67.947101,44.402068],[-67.946867,44.402158],[-67.946645,44.402173],[-67.946296,44.402128],[-67.946053,44.402042],[-67.945787,44.401931],[-67.945591,44.401812],[-67.945313,44.401709],[-67.945071,44.401523],[-67.944945,44.40143],[-67.944865,44.401304],[-67.944763,44.401152],[-67.944708,44.400985],[-67.94471,44.400851],[-67.944736,44.400709],[-67.944808,44.400585]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":"21211","type":"SMA","name":"Franklin Island National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"33FF0000","lineColor":"FFFF0000","information":"<b>No Take Area<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>Franklin Island is closed to public access during the seabird nesting season: April 1 to July 31.

Shoe Island (one acre), Pismire Island (two acres), and Scarecrow Island (seven acres) were the first to be acquired in 1947 and were designated as Federal Wilderness Areas in 1970. Thunder Bay Island (218 acres) and Gull Island (230 acres) were acquired from the U.S. Coast Guard in the 1960s. Hat Island (11 acres) was procured from The Nature Conservancy in 1994. In 1943, during World War II, Hat Island was bombed for target practice by the U.S. Navy. At that time, Hat Island was burned and partially covered in tar reducing its vegetation, but once left to natural processes, trees, other vegetation, and wildlife eventually returned. Big and Little Charity were acquired in 1999 through a Natural Resources Damage Assessment agreement with the General Motors Corporation. During the 1600s, the Charity Islands were used as an overnight stopping point by early French explorers such as Jean Nicolet and Robert de LaSalle and have been a refuge for boaters stranded during storms on Lake Huron. The most recent island added to the refuge is Sugar Island (143 acres), which was acquired from The Nature Conservancy in 2010.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For the latest updates, consult the Michigan Department of Fish and Game <a href=\"https:\/\/www.michigan.gov\/dnr\/0,4570,7-153-10364_63235---,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" >Website<\/a>.

Shoe Island (one acre), Pismire Island (two acres), and Scarecrow Island (seven acres) were the first to be acquired in 1947 and were designated as Federal Wilderness Areas in 1970. Thunder Bay Island (218 acres) and Gull Island (230 acres) were acquired from the U.S. Coast Guard in the 1960s. Hat Island (11 acres) was procured from The Nature Conservancy in 1994. In 1943, during World War II, Hat Island was bombed for target practice by the U.S. Navy. At that time, Hat Island was burned and partially covered in tar reducing its vegetation, but once left to natural processes, trees, other vegetation, and wildlife eventually returned. Big and Little Charity were acquired in 1999 through a Natural Resources Damage Assessment agreement with the General Motors Corporation. During the 1600s, the Charity Islands were used as an overnight stopping point by early French explorers such as Jean Nicolet and Robert de LaSalle and have been a refuge for boaters stranded during storms on Lake Huron. The most recent island added to the refuge is Sugar Island (143 acres), which was acquired from The Nature Conservancy in 2010.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For the latest updates, consult the Michigan Department of Fish and Game <a href=\"https:\/\/www.michigan.gov\/dnr\/0,4570,7-153-10364_63235---,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" >Website<\/a>.

Shoe Island (one acre), Pismire Island (two acres), and Scarecrow Island (seven acres) were the first to be acquired in 1947 and were designated as Federal Wilderness Areas in 1970. Thunder Bay Island (218 acres) and Gull Island (230 acres) were acquired from the U.S. Coast Guard in the 1960s. Hat Island (11 acres) was procured from The Nature Conservancy in 1994. In 1943, during World War II, Hat Island was bombed for target practice by the U.S. Navy. At that time, Hat Island was burned and partially covered in tar reducing its vegetation, but once left to natural processes, trees, other vegetation, and wildlife eventually returned. Big and Little Charity were acquired in 1999 through a Natural Resources Damage Assessment agreement with the General Motors Corporation. During the 1600s, the Charity Islands were used as an overnight stopping point by early French explorers such as Jean Nicolet and Robert de LaSalle and have been a refuge for boaters stranded during storms on Lake Huron. The most recent island added to the refuge is Sugar Island (143 acres), which was acquired from The Nature Conservancy in 2010.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For the latest updates, consult the Michigan Department of Fish and Game <a href=\"https:\/\/www.michigan.gov\/dnr\/0,4570,7-153-10364_63235---,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" >Website<\/a>.

Shoe Island (one acre), Pismire Island (two acres), and Scarecrow Island (seven acres) were the first to be acquired in 1947 and were designated as Federal Wilderness Areas in 1970. Thunder Bay Island (218 acres) and Gull Island (230 acres) were acquired from the U.S. Coast Guard in the 1960s. Hat Island (11 acres) was procured from The Nature Conservancy in 1994. In 1943, during World War II, Hat Island was bombed for target practice by the U.S. Navy. At that time, Hat Island was burned and partially covered in tar reducing its vegetation, but once left to natural processes, trees, other vegetation, and wildlife eventually returned. Big and Little Charity were acquired in 1999 through a Natural Resources Damage Assessment agreement with the General Motors Corporation. During the 1600s, the Charity Islands were used as an overnight stopping point by early French explorers such as Jean Nicolet and Robert de LaSalle and have been a refuge for boaters stranded during storms on Lake Huron.

Shoe Island (one acre), Pismire Island (two acres), and Scarecrow Island (seven acres) were the first to be acquired in 1947 and were designated as Federal Wilderness Areas in 1970. Thunder Bay Island (218 acres) and Gull Island (230 acres) were acquired from the U.S. Coast Guard in the 1960s. Hat Island (11 acres) was procured from The Nature Conservancy in 1994. In 1943, during World War II, Hat Island was bombed for target practice by the U.S. Navy. At that time, Hat Island was burned and partially covered in tar reducing its vegetation, but once left to natural processes, trees, other vegetation, and wildlife eventually returned. Big and Little Charity were acquired in 1999 through a Natural Resources Damage Assessment agreement with the General Motors Corporation. During the 1600s, the Charity Islands were used as an overnight stopping point by early French explorers such as Jean Nicolet and Robert de LaSalle and have been a refuge for boaters stranded during storms on Lake Huron. The most recent island added to the refuge is Sugar Island (143 acres), which was acquired from The Nature Conservancy in 2010.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For the latest updates, consult the Michigan Department of Fish and Game <a href=\"https:\/\/www.michigan.gov\/dnr\/0,4570,7-153-10364_63235---,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" >Website<\/a>.

Shoe Island (one acre), Pismire Island (two acres), and Scarecrow Island (seven acres) were the first to be acquired in 1947 and were designated as Federal Wilderness Areas in 1970. Thunder Bay Island (218 acres) and Gull Island (230 acres) were acquired from the U.S. Coast Guard in the 1960s. Hat Island (11 acres) was procured from The Nature Conservancy in 1994. In 1943, during World War II, Hat Island was bombed for target practice by the U.S. Navy. At that time, Hat Island was burned and partially covered in tar reducing its vegetation, but once left to natural processes, trees, other vegetation, and wildlife eventually returned. Big and Little Charity were acquired in 1999 through a Natural Resources Damage Assessment agreement with the General Motors Corporation. During the 1600s, the Charity Islands were used as an overnight stopping point by early French explorers such as Jean Nicolet and Robert de LaSalle and have been a refuge for boaters stranded during storms on Lake Huron.
