The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.094,44.507],[-124.094,44.507],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.09,44.509],[-124.09,44.509],[-124.09,44.509],[-124.09,44.509],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.092,44.506],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505]]]}},{"id":"21285","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.073,44.787],[-124.073,44.787],[-124.073,44.787],[-124.073,44.787],[-124.073,44.787],[-124.073,44.787],[-124.074,44.787],[-124.074,44.787],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.073,44.792],[-124.073,44.792],[-124.073,44.792],[-124.073,44.792],[-124.073,44.792],[-124.073,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.072,44.794],[-124.072,44.794],[-124.072,44.793],[-124.072,44.793],[-124.072,44.793],[-124.072,44.793],[-124.072,44.792],[-124.072,44.792],[-124.072,44.792],[-124.072,44.792],[-124.073,44.791],[-124.073,44.791],[-124.073,44.79],[-124.073,44.79],[-124.073,44.79],[-124.073,44.789],[-124.073,44.789],[-124.073,44.788],[-124.073,44.788],[-124.073,44.787],[-124.073,44.787]]]}},{"id":"21302","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.022,45.025],[-124.022,45.025],[-124.022,45.025],[-124.022,45.025],[-124.022,45.025],[-124.022,45.025],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.021,45.028],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.019,45.029],[-124.019,45.029],[-124.019,45.029],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.026],[-124.018,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.021,45.025]]]}},{"id":"21315","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.009,45.074],[-124.009,45.074],[-124.01,45.074],[-124.01,45.074],[-124.01,45.074],[-124.01,45.074],[-124.01,45.075],[-124.01,45.075],[-124.01,45.075],[-124.01,45.075],[-124.01,45.075],[-124.01,45.075],[-124.01,45.075],[-124.01,45.075],[-124.01,45.075],[-124.01,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.075],[-124.011,45.076],[-124.011,45.076],[-124.011,45.076],[-124.011,45.076],[-124.011,45.076],[-124.01,45.076],[-124.01,45.076],[-124.009,45.076],[-124.008,45.075],[-124.007,45.075],[-124.007,45.075],[-124.008,45.075],[-124.008,45.074],[-124.009,45.074]]]}},{"id":"21320","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.222],[-123.974,45.222],[-123.975,45.222],[-123.976,45.223],[-123.976,45.222],[-123.976,45.222],[-123.976,45.222],[-123.977,45.221],[-123.978,45.221],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.977,45.22],[-123.977,45.221],[-123.977,45.221],[-123.977,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.223],[-123.98,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.224],[-123.979,45.224],[-123.979,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.225],[-123.978,45.225],[-123.978,45.225],[-123.978,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.224],[-123.975,45.224],[-123.975,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224]]]}},{"id":"21326","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.336],[-123.983,45.336],[-123.983,45.336],[-123.983,45.336],[-123.983,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.988,45.337],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.987,45.339],[-123.986,45.338],[-123.985,45.338],[-123.983,45.339],[-123.981,45.339],[-123.98,45.339],[-123.979,45.339],[-123.978,45.339],[-123.978,45.339],[-123.978,45.339],[-123.978,45.339],[-123.977,45.339],[-123.977,45.339],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338]]]}},{"id":"21328","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

All coastal rocks and islands are off-limits, and all watercraft should stay at least 500 feet away. <\/p><b>Allowed:<\/b><p>Recreational fishing may be permitted in defined areas subject to state fishing regulations.<\/p><b>Purpose:<\/b><p>To administer a national network of lands and waters for the conservation, management, and where appropriate, restoration of the fish, wildlife, and plant resources and their habitats within the United States. The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.974,45.484],[-123.973,45.484],[-123.973,45.484],[-123.973,45.484],[-123.972,45.483],[-123.973,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.973,45.482],[-123.973,45.482],[-123.973,45.482],[-123.972,45.482],[-123.971,45.482],[-123.97,45.482],[-123.97,45.482],[-123.97,45.481],[-123.97,45.48],[-123.97,45.479],[-123.97,45.479],[-123.969,45.479],[-123.969,45.479],[-123.969,45.479],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.483],[-123.975,45.483],[-123.975,45.483],[-123.975,45.483],[-123.975,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.484],[-123.974,45.484],[-123.974,45.484],[-123.974,45.484],[-123.974,45.484]]]}},{"id":"21333","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.495],[-123.986,45.495],[-123.986,45.495],[-123.986,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.985,45.497],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.984,45.498],[-123.984,45.498],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.982,45.497],[-123.982,45.497],[-123.982,45.497],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494]]]}},{"id":"21335","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.997,45.763],[-123.997,45.763],[-123.997,45.763],[-123.997,45.763],[-123.997,45.763],[-123.997,45.763],[-123.997,45.763],[-123.997,45.763],[-123.997,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.998,45.763],[-123.999,45.763],[-123.999,45.763],[-123.999,45.763],[-123.999,45.763],[-123.999,45.763],[-123.999,45.763],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.764],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.999,45.765],[-123.998,45.765],[-123.998,45.765],[-123.998,45.765],[-123.998,45.765],[-123.998,45.765],[-123.998,45.765],[-123.998,45.766],[-123.998,45.766],[-123.998,45.766],[-123.998,45.766],[-123.998,45.766],[-123.998,45.766],[-123.998,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.997,45.766],[-123.996,45.766],[-123.996,45.766],[-123.996,45.766],[-123.996,45.766],[-123.996,45.766],[-123.996,45.765],[-123.996,45.765],[-123.996,45.765],[-123.996,45.765],[-123.996,45.765],[-123.996,45.765],[-123.996,45.765],[-123.996,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.765],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.764],[-123.995,45.763],[-123.995,45.763],[-123.995,45.763],[-123.995,45.763],[-123.995,45.763],[-123.995,45.763],[-123.995,45.763],[-123.995,45.763],[-123.995,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.996,45.763],[-123.997,45.763],[-123.997,45.763],[-123.997,45.763],[-123.997,45.763]]]}},{"id":"21339","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.983,45.804],[-123.983,45.804],[-123.983,45.804],[-123.983,45.804],[-123.983,45.804],[-123.983,45.804],[-123.983,45.804],[-123.983,45.804],[-123.983,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.984,45.804],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.985,45.805],[-123.986,45.805],[-123.986,45.805],[-123.986,45.805],[-123.986,45.806],[-123.986,45.806],[-123.986,45.806],[-123.986,45.806],[-123.986,45.806],[-123.986,45.806],[-123.986,45.806],[-123.986,45.806],[-123.986,45.806],[-123.985,45.806],[-123.985,45.806],[-123.985,45.806],[-123.985,45.806],[-123.985,45.806],[-123.985,45.806],[-123.985,45.806],[-123.985,45.806],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.985,45.807],[-123.984,45.807],[-123.984,45.807],[-123.984,45.807],[-123.984,45.807],[-123.984,45.807],[-123.984,45.807],[-123.984,45.807],[-123.984,45.807],[-123.984,45.807],[-123.984,45.808],[-123.984,45.808],[-123.984,45.808],[-123.984,45.808],[-123.983,45.808],[-123.983,45.808],[-123.983,45.808],[-123.983,45.808],[-123.983,45.808],[-123.983,45.808],[-123.983,45.808],[-123.983,45.808],[-123.983,45.808],[-123.983,45.808],[-123.983,45.807],[-123.983,45.807],[-123.982,45.807],[-123.982,45.807],[-123.982,45.807],[-123.982,45.807],[-123.982,45.807],[-123.982,45.807],[-123.982,45.807],[-123.982,45.807],[-123.982,45.807],[-123.982,45.807],[-123.982,45.807],[-123.982,45.807],[-123.981,45.807],[-123.981,45.807],[-123.981,45.807],[-123.981,45.807],[-123.981,45.807],[-123.981,45.807],[-123.981,45.807],[-123.981,45.807],[-123.981,45.807],[-123.981,45.807],[-123.981,45.807],[-123.981,45.807],[-123.981,45.806],[-123.981,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.806],[-123.98,45.805],[-123.98,45.805],[-123.98,45.805],[-123.98,45.805],[-123.98,45.805],[-123.98,45.805],[-123.98,45.805],[-123.98,45.805],[-123.98,45.805],[-123.98,45.805],[-123.98,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.805],[-123.981,45.804],[-123.981,45.804],[-123.981,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.982,45.804],[-123.983,45.804],[-123.983,45.804],[-123.983,45.804],[-123.983,45.804]]]}},{"id":"21343","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.962,45.834],[-123.962,45.833],[-123.962,45.833],[-123.962,45.833],[-123.962,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.963,45.835],[-123.963,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.836],[-123.964,45.836],[-123.964,45.836],[-123.964,45.836],[-123.964,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.838],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.836],[-123.962,45.835],[-123.962,45.834]]]}},{"id":"21345","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.01,45.936],[-124.01,45.936],[-124.01,45.936],[-124.01,45.936],[-124.01,45.936],[-124.01,45.936],[-124.01,45.936],[-124.01,45.936],[-124.011,45.936],[-124.011,45.936],[-124.011,45.936],[-124.011,45.936],[-124.011,45.936],[-124.011,45.936],[-124.011,45.936],[-124.011,45.936],[-124.011,45.936],[-124.011,45.936],[-124.011,45.936],[-124.011,45.937],[-124.011,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.937],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.938],[-124.012,45.939],[-124.012,45.939],[-124.012,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.011,45.939],[-124.01,45.939],[-124.01,45.939],[-124.01,45.939],[-124.01,45.939],[-124.01,45.939],[-124.01,45.939],[-124.01,45.939],[-124.01,45.939],[-124.01,45.939],[-124.01,45.939],[-124.01,45.939],[-124.01,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.009,45.939],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.938],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.008,45.937],[-124.009,45.937],[-124.009,45.937],[-124.009,45.937],[-124.009,45.937],[-124.009,45.936],[-124.009,45.936],[-124.009,45.936],[-124.009,45.936],[-124.009,45.936],[-124.009,45.936],[-124.009,45.936],[-124.009,45.936],[-124.009,45.936],[-124.009,45.936],[-124.01,45.936],[-124.01,45.936],[-124.01,45.936],[-124.01,45.936],[-124.01,45.936]]]}},{"id":"21353","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.24,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.241,42.003],[-124.242,42.003],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.004],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.005],[-124.242,42.006],[-124.242,42.006],[-124.242,42.006],[-124.242,42.006],[-124.242,42.006],[-124.242,42.006],[-124.242,42.006],[-124.242,42.006],[-124.242,42.006],[-124.242,42.006],[-124.241,42.006],[-124.241,42.006],[-124.241,42.006],[-124.241,42.006],[-124.241,42.006],[-124.241,42.006],[-124.241,42.006],[-124.241,42.006],[-124.241,42.006],[-124.241,42.006],[-124.241,42.006],[-124.241,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.24,42.006],[-124.239,42.006],[-124.239,42.006],[-124.239,42.006],[-124.239,42.006],[-124.239,42.006],[-124.239,42.006],[-124.239,42.006],[-124.239,42.006],[-124.239,42.006],[-124.239,42.006],[-124.239,42.006],[-124.239,42.006],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.005],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.239,42.004],[-124.24,42.004],[-124.24,42.003],[-124.24,42.003],[-124.24,42.003],[-124.24,42.003],[-124.24,42.003],[-124.24,42.003],[-124.24,42.003],[-124.24,42.003],[-124.24,42.003],[-124.24,42.003],[-124.24,42.003],[-124.24,42.003],[-124.24,42.003]]]}},{"id":"21362","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.33,42.076],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075]]]}},{"id":"21368","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.344,42.081],[-124.344,42.081],[-124.344,42.081],[-124.344,42.081],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.081],[-124.342,42.081],[-124.342,42.081],[-124.342,42.081],[-124.342,42.081],[-124.342,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.342,42.08],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079]]]}},{"id":"21370","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.358,42.096],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.354,42.099],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096]]]}},{"id":"21372","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

All coastal rocks and islands are off-limits, and all watercraft should stay at least 500 feet away. <\/p><b>Allowed:<\/b><p>Recreational fishing may be permitted in defined areas subject to state fishing regulations.<\/p><b>Purpose:<\/b><p>To administer a national network of lands and waters for the conservation, management, and where appropriate, restoration of the fish, wildlife, and plant resources and their habitats within the United States. The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.373,42.174],[-124.373,42.174],[-124.373,42.174],[-124.373,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.374,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.174],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.175],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.375,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.374,42.176],[-124.373,42.176],[-124.373,42.176],[-124.373,42.176],[-124.373,42.177],[-124.373,42.176],[-124.373,42.176],[-124.373,42.176],[-124.373,42.176],[-124.373,42.176],[-124.373,42.176],[-124.373,42.176],[-124.373,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.372,42.176],[-124.371,42.176],[-124.371,42.176],[-124.371,42.176],[-124.371,42.176],[-124.371,42.176],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.175],[-124.371,42.174],[-124.371,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.372,42.174],[-124.373,42.174],[-124.373,42.174],[-124.373,42.174],[-124.373,42.174],[-124.373,42.174],[-124.373,42.174],[-124.373,42.174],[-124.373,42.174],[-124.373,42.174]]]}},{"id":"21379","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.391,42.209],[-124.391,42.209],[-124.391,42.209],[-124.391,42.209],[-124.391,42.209],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.392,42.21],[-124.392,42.21],[-124.392,42.21],[-124.392,42.21],[-124.392,42.21],[-124.392,42.21],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.391,42.212],[-124.391,42.212],[-124.391,42.212],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.212],[-124.389,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.386,42.211],[-124.386,42.211],[-124.386,42.211],[-124.386,42.211],[-124.386,42.211],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.209],[-124.386,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209]]]}},{"id":"21381","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.418,42.23],[-124.418,42.23],[-124.418,42.23],[-124.418,42.23],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.234],[-124.417,42.234],[-124.417,42.234],[-124.417,42.234],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.416,42.231],[-124.416,42.231],[-124.416,42.231],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23]]]}},{"id":"21385","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.397,42.24],[-124.397,42.239],[-124.396,42.239],[-124.396,42.238],[-124.395,42.238],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237]]]}},{"id":"21387","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.421,42.314],[-124.421,42.314],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.418,42.318],[-124.418,42.318],[-124.418,42.318],[-124.418,42.318],[-124.418,42.318],[-124.418,42.317],[-124.418,42.317],[-124.418,42.316],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314]]]}},{"id":"21393","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.387],[-124.425,42.387],[-124.425,42.387],[-124.424,42.387],[-124.424,42.387],[-124.424,42.386],[-124.424,42.386],[-124.424,42.386],[-124.424,42.386],[-124.424,42.386],[-124.424,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386]]]}},{"id":"21399","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.43,42.449],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.446],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.429,42.449],[-124.43,42.449]]]}},{"id":"21402","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission;

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.479,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.48,42.453],[-124.481,42.453],[-124.481,42.453],[-124.481,42.453],[-124.481,42.453],[-124.481,42.453],[-124.481,42.453],[-124.481,42.453],[-124.481,42.453],[-124.481,42.453],[-124.481,42.453],[-124.481,42.453],[-124.481,42.453],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.454],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.481,42.455],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.48,42.456],[-124.479,42.456],[-124.479,42.456],[-124.479,42.456],[-124.479,42.456],[-124.479,42.456],[-124.479,42.456],[-124.479,42.456],[-124.479,42.456],[-124.479,42.456],[-124.479,42.456],[-124.479,42.456],[-124.479,42.456],[-124.478,42.456],[-124.478,42.456],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.455],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.477,42.454],[-124.477,42.454],[-124.477,42.454],[-124.477,42.454],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.478,42.454],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.478,42.453],[-124.479,42.453],[-124.479,42.453],[-124.479,42.453],[-124.479,42.453],[-124.479,42.453],[-124.479,42.453],[-124.479,42.453],[-124.479,42.453],[-124.479,42.453],[-124.479,42.453],[-124.479,42.453],[-124.479,42.453],[-124.479,42.453]]]}},{"id":"21405","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.485,42.455],[-124.486,42.455],[-124.486,42.455],[-124.486,42.455],[-124.486,42.455],[-124.486,42.455],[-124.486,42.455],[-124.486,42.455],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.456],[-124.486,42.457],[-124.486,42.457],[-124.486,42.457],[-124.486,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.485,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.484,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.483,42.457],[-124.482,42.457],[-124.482,42.457],[-124.482,42.457],[-124.482,42.457],[-124.482,42.457],[-124.482,42.457],[-124.482,42.457],[-124.482,42.457],[-124.482,42.457],[-124.482,42.457],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.456],[-124.482,42.455],[-124.482,42.455],[-124.482,42.455],[-124.482,42.455],[-124.482,42.455],[-124.482,42.455],[-124.482,42.455],[-124.482,42.455],[-124.482,42.455],[-124.482,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.483,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455],[-124.484,42.455]]]}},{"id":"21407","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.437,42.458],[-124.437,42.458],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.436,42.459],[-124.436,42.459],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456]]]}},{"id":"21409","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.46],[-124.434,42.46],[-124.434,42.46],[-124.434,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46]]]}},{"id":"21411","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.464],[-124.499,42.464],[-124.499,42.464],[-124.499,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.497,42.464],[-124.497,42.464],[-124.497,42.464],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.499,42.462],[-124.499,42.462],[-124.499,42.462],[-124.499,42.462],[-124.499,42.462],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.502,42.461],[-124.502,42.461],[-124.502,42.461],[-124.502,42.461],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.502,42.463],[-124.502,42.463],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.5,42.464],[-124.5,42.464],[-124.5,42.464],[-124.5,42.464],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465]]]}},{"id":"21413","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.439,42.473],[-124.44,42.473],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.474],[-124.44,42.475],[-124.44,42.475],[-124.44,42.475],[-124.44,42.475],[-124.44,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.439,42.475],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.438,42.476],[-124.437,42.476],[-124.437,42.476],[-124.437,42.476],[-124.437,42.476],[-124.437,42.476],[-124.437,42.476],[-124.437,42.475],[-124.437,42.475],[-124.437,42.475],[-124.437,42.475],[-124.437,42.475],[-124.437,42.475],[-124.437,42.475],[-124.437,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.475],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.474],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.436,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.437,42.473],[-124.438,42.473],[-124.438,42.473]]]}},{"id":"21415","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.445,42.481],[-124.445,42.481],[-124.445,42.481],[-124.445,42.481],[-124.445,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.481],[-124.446,42.482],[-124.446,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.482],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.483],[-124.447,42.484],[-124.447,42.484],[-124.447,42.484],[-124.447,42.484],[-124.447,42.484],[-124.447,42.484],[-124.447,42.484],[-124.447,42.484],[-124.447,42.484],[-124.447,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.446,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.445,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.444,42.484],[-124.443,42.484],[-124.443,42.484],[-124.443,42.484],[-124.443,42.484],[-124.443,42.484],[-124.443,42.484],[-124.443,42.484],[-124.443,42.484],[-124.443,42.484],[-124.443,42.484],[-124.443,42.484],[-124.443,42.484],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.483],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.443,42.482],[-124.444,42.482],[-124.444,42.482],[-124.444,42.482],[-124.444,42.482],[-124.444,42.482],[-124.444,42.482],[-124.444,42.481],[-124.444,42.481],[-124.444,42.481],[-124.444,42.481],[-124.444,42.481],[-124.444,42.481],[-124.444,42.481],[-124.444,42.481],[-124.444,42.481],[-124.445,42.481],[-124.445,42.481],[-124.445,42.481],[-124.445,42.481],[-124.445,42.481],[-124.445,42.481],[-124.445,42.481],[-124.445,42.481]]]}},{"id":"21417","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.434,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.435,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.497],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.498],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.436,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.435,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.434,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.499],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.498],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.433,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497],[-124.434,42.497]]]}},{"id":"21419","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

All coastal rocks and islands are off-limits, and all watercraft should stay at least 500 feet away. <\/p><b>Allowed:<\/b><p>Recreational fishing may be permitted in defined areas subject to state fishing regulations.<\/p><b>Purpose:<\/b><p>To administer a national network of lands and waters for the conservation, management, and where appropriate, restoration of the fish, wildlife, and plant resources and their habitats within the United States. The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.44,42.496],[-124.44,42.496],[-124.44,42.496],[-124.44,42.496],[-124.44,42.496],[-124.44,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.441,42.496],[-124.442,42.496],[-124.442,42.496],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.442,42.497],[-124.443,42.497],[-124.443,42.497],[-124.443,42.497],[-124.443,42.497],[-124.443,42.497],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.443,42.498],[-124.442,42.498],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.442,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.441,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.44,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.499],[-124.439,42.498],[-124.439,42.498],[-124.439,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.498],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.438,42.497],[-124.439,42.497],[-124.439,42.497],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.439,42.496],[-124.44,42.496],[-124.44,42.496],[-124.44,42.496],[-124.44,42.496],[-124.44,42.496],[-124.44,42.496],[-124.44,42.496]]]}},{"id":"21420","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.46,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.461,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.507],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.508],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.462,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.461,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.46,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.509],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.508],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.459,42.507],[-124.46,42.507],[-124.46,42.507],[-124.46,42.507],[-124.46,42.507],[-124.46,42.507],[-124.46,42.507],[-124.46,42.507],[-124.46,42.507],[-124.46,42.507],[-124.46,42.507],[-124.46,42.507],[-124.46,42.507],[-124.46,42.507]]]}},{"id":"21424","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.572],[-124.391,42.572],[-124.391,42.572],[-124.391,42.572],[-124.391,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.396,42.571],[-124.396,42.571],[-124.396,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.394,42.572],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573]]]}},{"id":"21426","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.584],[-124.413,42.584],[-124.413,42.584],[-124.413,42.584],[-124.413,42.584],[-124.413,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.585],[-124.41,42.585],[-124.41,42.585],[-124.41,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.583],[-124.409,42.583],[-124.409,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583]]]}},{"id":"21428","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.404,42.619],[-124.404,42.619],[-124.404,42.619],[-124.404,42.619],[-124.404,42.619],[-124.404,42.619],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.405,42.62],[-124.405,42.62],[-124.405,42.62],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.404,42.621],[-124.404,42.621],[-124.404,42.621],[-124.404,42.621],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.622],[-124.401,42.622],[-124.402,42.621],[-124.402,42.62],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619]]]}},{"id":"21432","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.434,42.67],[-124.433,42.67],[-124.432,42.669],[-124.432,42.669],[-124.432,42.669],[-124.432,42.669],[-124.432,42.669],[-124.432,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.438,42.669],[-124.438,42.669],[-124.438,42.669],[-124.438,42.669],[-124.438,42.669],[-124.438,42.669],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.441,42.67],[-124.441,42.67],[-124.441,42.67],[-124.441,42.67],[-124.441,42.67],[-124.441,42.67],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.672],[-124.441,42.672],[-124.441,42.672],[-124.441,42.672],[-124.441,42.672],[-124.44,42.672],[-124.439,42.671],[-124.437,42.671],[-124.435,42.67],[-124.435,42.67],[-124.435,42.67],[-124.434,42.67]]]}},{"id":"21436","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.473,42.704],[-124.473,42.704],[-124.473,42.704],[-124.473,42.704],[-124.473,42.704],[-124.473,42.704],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.473,42.702],[-124.473,42.702],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701]]]}},{"id":"21443","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.477,42.73],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.735],[-124.479,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.477,42.735],[-124.477,42.735],[-124.477,42.735],[-124.476,42.734],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.73],[-124.475,42.73],[-124.475,42.73],[-124.475,42.73],[-124.475,42.73],[-124.475,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73]]]}},{"id":"21446","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.501,42.739],[-124.5,42.739],[-124.499,42.739],[-124.499,42.739],[-124.499,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.499,42.739],[-124.499,42.739],[-124.498,42.74],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.739],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.498,42.738],[-124.499,42.738],[-124.499,42.738],[-124.499,42.738],[-124.499,42.738],[-124.499,42.738],[-124.499,42.737],[-124.499,42.737],[-124.499,42.737],[-124.499,42.737],[-124.499,42.737],[-124.499,42.737],[-124.499,42.737],[-124.499,42.737],[-124.499,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.5,42.737],[-124.501,42.737],[-124.501,42.737],[-124.501,42.737],[-124.501,42.737],[-124.501,42.737],[-124.501,42.737],[-124.501,42.737],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.501,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.502,42.738],[-124.503,42.738],[-124.503,42.738],[-124.503,42.738],[-124.503,42.738],[-124.503,42.738],[-124.503,42.738],[-124.503,42.738],[-124.503,42.738],[-124.503,42.738],[-124.503,42.738],[-124.503,42.738],[-124.503,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.738],[-124.504,42.739],[-124.504,42.739],[-124.504,42.739],[-124.504,42.739],[-124.504,42.74],[-124.504,42.74],[-124.504,42.74],[-124.504,42.74],[-124.503,42.739],[-124.503,42.74],[-124.503,42.74],[-124.503,42.74],[-124.503,42.74],[-124.503,42.74],[-124.502,42.74],[-124.502,42.74],[-124.501,42.74],[-124.501,42.739]]]}},{"id":"21449","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.524,42.74],[-124.524,42.74],[-124.524,42.74],[-124.524,42.74],[-124.524,42.74],[-124.524,42.74],[-124.524,42.74],[-124.524,42.74],[-124.524,42.74],[-124.524,42.74],[-124.524,42.74],[-124.524,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.741],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.742],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.525,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.524,42.743],[-124.523,42.743],[-124.523,42.743],[-124.523,42.743],[-124.523,42.743],[-124.523,42.743],[-124.523,42.743],[-124.523,42.743],[-124.523,42.743],[-124.523,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.522,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.521,42.743],[-124.52,42.743],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.742],[-124.52,42.741],[-124.52,42.741],[-124.52,42.741],[-124.52,42.741],[-124.52,42.741],[-124.52,42.741],[-124.52,42.741],[-124.52,42.741],[-124.52,42.741],[-124.52,42.741],[-124.52,42.741],[-124.521,42.741],[-124.521,42.741],[-124.521,42.741],[-124.521,42.741],[-124.521,42.741],[-124.521,42.741],[-124.521,42.741],[-124.521,42.741],[-124.521,42.741],[-124.521,42.741],[-124.521,42.741],[-124.521,42.74],[-124.521,42.74],[-124.521,42.74],[-124.521,42.74],[-124.521,42.74],[-124.521,42.74],[-124.522,42.74],[-124.522,42.74],[-124.522,42.74],[-124.522,42.74],[-124.522,42.74],[-124.522,42.74],[-124.522,42.74],[-124.522,42.74],[-124.522,42.74],[-124.522,42.74],[-124.522,42.74],[-124.522,42.74],[-124.523,42.74],[-124.523,42.74]]]}},{"id":"21454","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.637,42.767],[-124.638,42.767],[-124.638,42.767],[-124.638,42.767],[-124.638,42.767],[-124.638,42.767],[-124.638,42.767],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.768],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.769],[-124.638,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.637,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.636,42.77],[-124.635,42.77],[-124.635,42.77],[-124.635,42.77],[-124.635,42.77],[-124.635,42.77],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.635,42.769],[-124.634,42.769],[-124.634,42.769],[-124.634,42.769],[-124.634,42.768],[-124.634,42.768],[-124.634,42.768],[-124.634,42.768],[-124.634,42.768],[-124.634,42.768],[-124.634,42.768],[-124.634,42.768],[-124.635,42.768],[-124.635,42.768],[-124.635,42.768],[-124.635,42.768],[-124.635,42.768],[-124.635,42.768],[-124.635,42.768],[-124.635,42.768],[-124.635,42.768],[-124.635,42.768],[-124.635,42.768],[-124.635,42.768],[-124.635,42.767],[-124.635,42.767],[-124.635,42.767],[-124.635,42.767],[-124.635,42.767],[-124.635,42.767],[-124.635,42.767],[-124.635,42.767],[-124.635,42.767],[-124.635,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767],[-124.636,42.767]]]}},{"id":"21456","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.59,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.59,42.791],[-124.59,42.791],[-124.59,42.791],[-124.59,42.791],[-124.59,42.791],[-124.59,42.791],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788]]]}},{"id":"21461","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.605,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.796],[-124.606,42.797],[-124.606,42.797],[-124.606,42.797],[-124.607,42.797],[-124.607,42.797],[-124.607,42.797],[-124.607,42.797],[-124.607,42.797],[-124.607,42.797],[-124.607,42.797],[-124.607,42.797],[-124.607,42.797],[-124.607,42.797],[-124.607,42.797],[-124.606,42.797],[-124.606,42.797],[-124.606,42.797],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.606,42.798],[-124.605,42.798],[-124.605,42.798],[-124.605,42.798],[-124.605,42.798],[-124.605,42.798],[-124.605,42.798],[-124.605,42.798],[-124.605,42.798],[-124.605,42.798],[-124.605,42.798],[-124.605,42.798],[-124.605,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.604,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.798],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.797],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.603,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.604,42.796],[-124.605,42.796]]]}},{"id":"21464","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.823],[-124.585,42.823],[-124.585,42.823],[-124.585,42.823],[-124.585,42.823],[-124.585,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.824],[-124.582,42.824],[-124.582,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.822],[-124.582,42.822],[-124.582,42.822],[-124.582,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822]]]}},{"id":"21466","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.574,42.842],[-124.574,42.842],[-124.574,42.842],[-124.574,42.842],[-124.574,42.842],[-124.574,42.842],[-124.574,42.842],[-124.574,42.842],[-124.574,42.842],[-124.574,42.842],[-124.574,42.842],[-124.574,42.842],[-124.574,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.842],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.576,42.843],[-124.576,42.843],[-124.576,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.843],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.575,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.574,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.573,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.844],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.843],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.572,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.573,42.842],[-124.574,42.842]]]}},{"id":"21472","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.549,42.848],[-124.549,42.848],[-124.549,42.848],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.546,42.85],[-124.546,42.85],[-124.546,42.85],[-124.546,42.85],[-124.547,42.849],[-124.548,42.848],[-124.548,42.848],[-124.549,42.847],[-124.549,42.846]]]}},{"id":"21475","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.435,43.082],[-124.435,43.081],[-124.436,43.079],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.08],[-124.44,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.435,43.082],[-124.435,43.082],[-124.435,43.082],[-124.435,43.082],[-124.435,43.082]]]}},{"id":"21483","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.457,43.112],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.115],[-124.458,43.115],[-124.458,43.115],[-124.458,43.115],[-124.458,43.115],[-124.458,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.454,43.115],[-124.454,43.115],[-124.454,43.115],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112]]]}},{"id":"21485","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.387,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.388,43.256],[-124.389,43.256],[-124.389,43.256],[-124.389,43.256],[-124.389,43.256],[-124.389,43.256],[-124.389,43.256],[-124.389,43.256],[-124.389,43.256],[-124.389,43.256],[-124.389,43.256],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.389,43.257],[-124.39,43.257],[-124.39,43.257],[-124.39,43.257],[-124.39,43.257],[-124.39,43.257],[-124.39,43.257],[-124.39,43.257],[-124.39,43.257],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.258],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.259],[-124.39,43.26],[-124.39,43.26],[-124.39,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.26],[-124.389,43.261],[-124.389,43.261],[-124.389,43.261],[-124.389,43.261],[-124.389,43.261],[-124.389,43.261],[-124.389,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.388,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.387,43.261],[-124.386,43.261],[-124.386,43.261],[-124.386,43.261],[-124.386,43.261],[-124.386,43.261],[-124.386,43.261],[-124.386,43.261],[-124.386,43.261],[-124.386,43.26],[-124.386,43.26],[-124.386,43.26],[-124.387,43.259],[-124.387,43.259],[-124.387,43.258],[-124.387,43.257],[-124.387,43.257],[-124.387,43.256],[-124.387,43.256],[-124.387,43.256],[-124.387,43.256],[-124.387,43.256],[-124.387,43.256],[-124.387,43.256],[-124.387,43.256],[-124.387,43.256],[-124.387,43.256],[-124.387,43.256]]]}},{"id":"21488","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.121,44.148],[-124.121,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.122,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.148],[-124.123,44.149],[-124.123,44.149],[-124.123,44.149],[-124.123,44.149],[-124.123,44.149],[-124.123,44.149],[-124.123,44.149],[-124.123,44.149],[-124.124,44.149],[-124.124,44.149],[-124.124,44.149],[-124.124,44.149],[-124.124,44.149],[-124.124,44.149],[-124.124,44.149],[-124.124,44.149],[-124.124,44.149],[-124.124,44.149],[-124.124,44.149],[-124.124,44.15],[-124.124,44.15],[-124.124,44.15],[-124.124,44.15],[-124.124,44.15],[-124.124,44.15],[-124.124,44.15],[-124.124,44.15],[-124.124,44.15],[-124.124,44.15],[-124.123,44.15],[-124.123,44.15],[-124.123,44.15],[-124.123,44.15],[-124.123,44.15],[-124.123,44.15],[-124.123,44.15],[-124.123,44.15],[-124.123,44.151],[-124.123,44.151],[-124.123,44.151],[-124.123,44.151],[-124.123,44.151],[-124.123,44.151],[-124.123,44.151],[-124.123,44.151],[-124.123,44.151],[-124.123,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.122,44.151],[-124.121,44.151],[-124.121,44.151],[-124.121,44.151],[-124.121,44.151],[-124.121,44.151],[-124.121,44.151],[-124.121,44.151],[-124.121,44.151],[-124.121,44.151],[-124.121,44.151],[-124.121,44.151],[-124.121,44.151],[-124.12,44.151],[-124.12,44.151],[-124.12,44.151],[-124.121,44.149],[-124.121,44.148],[-124.121,44.148],[-124.121,44.148],[-124.121,44.148],[-124.121,44.148],[-124.121,44.148],[-124.121,44.148]]]}},{"id":"21495","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.114,44.225],[-124.114,44.225],[-124.114,44.225],[-124.114,44.225],[-124.114,44.225],[-124.114,44.225],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.115,44.227],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.23],[-124.112,44.23],[-124.112,44.23],[-124.112,44.23],[-124.112,44.229],[-124.112,44.228],[-124.112,44.228],[-124.112,44.228],[-124.112,44.227],[-124.112,44.227],[-124.112,44.227],[-124.112,44.226],[-124.111,44.226],[-124.111,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225]]]}},{"id":"21501","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.104,44.329],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.333],[-124.102,44.333],[-124.102,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.332],[-124.101,44.332],[-124.101,44.332],[-124.101,44.331],[-124.101,44.331],[-124.101,44.331],[-124.101,44.33],[-124.102,44.33],[-124.102,44.33],[-124.102,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.102,44.329],[-124.102,44.329],[-124.103,44.329],[-124.103,44.328],[-124.103,44.328],[-124.103,44.328],[-124.104,44.327],[-124.104,44.327],[-124.104,44.327],[-124.104,44.327],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326]]]}},{"id":"21506","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

While most major estuaries in Washington have been filled, dredged, or developed, Nisqually River's has been set aside entirely for wildlife, protecting the delta and its diversity of fish and wildlife habitats.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"\u001cLatest Newsletters\" and \"Refuge Updates\" provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
