The Reserve encompasses black needle rush marshes, maritime pine forests, pine savanna, salt pannes, and pitcher plant bogs. Sea turtles, bottlenose dolphin and manatees can be found in the deeper waters of the reserve. Many species of carnivorous plants and orchids are present in the higher savanna habitats. Its productive oyster reefs and seagrass beds serve as nursery areas for important marine species, such as shrimp, blue crab, speckled trout and redfish.

The number of fishing poles is limited to 6 per person. All fishing poles and lines will be maintained at the surf's edge. The use of seine nets, trot lines, and jug lines are prohibited in the park. The use of sand pumps is prohibited.<br>2. Commercially caught fish that are legally caught in State waters but illegal to possess at Padre Island National Seashore may be transported through park waters only in the Bird Island Basin channel and in the Yarborough Pass channel. The possession of fish stocks exceeding personal limits by commercially licensed fishermen or in vessels within park waters when outside the Bird Island Basin channel or Yarborough Pass channel is considered prima facie evidence as to have been caught in park waters.<br>3. Hard hull motorized vessels are prohibited from launching into the Gulf of Mexico from all beaches within Padre Island National Seashore. All gulf beaches other than North Beach and South Beach are closed to launching motorized soft hulled motorized vessels. Operating a motorized vessel (or any vessel greater than 16 feet) within 500 feet of the Bird Island Basin shoreline from the Bird Island Basin channel to a point 1\/2 mile south of the Worldwinds Windsurfing concessions building is prohibited.<br>4. SCUBA and snorkeling is prohibited at Bird Island Basin and Yarborough Pass boat launch areas.<br>5.

A cast net (not exceeding 14 feet in diameter) or dip net (not exceeding 3 feet in diameter) may be used to take non-game fish for bait purposes only. Finger-sized mullet, anchovies, pinfish (piggy perch), croakers, menhaden, and other baitfish are permitted for use as bait. Gigging is allowed for non-game and non-protected game fish (ie: flounder, black drum, whiting, sheepshead) submerged attracting lights or lights attached to the end of the spears are allowed.<br>2. Zodiacs, Avons, and other soft hulled motorized vessels less than 12' in length are permitted to launch on North Beach or on South Beach below the 5 mile marker.<\/p><b>Purpose:<\/b><p>Padre Island National Seashore separates the Gulf of Mexico from the Laguna Madre, one of a few hypersaline lagoons in the world. The park protects 70 miles of coastline, dunes, prairies, and wind tidal flats teeming with life. It is a safe nesting ground for the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle and a haven for 380 bird species.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department's weekly fishing reports, check <a href=\"https:\/\/tpwd.texas.gov\/fishboat\/fish\/recreational\/fishreport.phtml\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.

During migration, species from the Central and Mississippi flyway converge in the the lower four counties of Texas known locally as the Lower Rio Grande Valley (Valley). Where possible, migrating birds avoid flying too far east (over the Gulf Coast) or too far west (over the desert) and end up funneling through this region. In addition, many birds from South and Central America reach the northernmost point of their range on the Rio Grande with some species literally not migrating any farther north than the river.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department's weekly fishing reports, check <a href=http:\/\/tpwd.texas.gov\/fishboat\/fish\/recreational\/fishreport.phtml target=_blank>here<\/a>.
