Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.224,42],[-124.224,42],[-124.224,42],[-124.224,42],[-124.224,42],[-124.224,42],[-124.224,42],[-124.224,42],[-124.225,42],[-124.225,42],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.225,42.001],[-124.226,42.001],[-124.226,42.001],[-124.226,42.001],[-124.226,42.001],[-124.226,42.001],[-124.226,42.001],[-124.226,42.001],[-124.226,42.001],[-124.226,42.001],[-124.226,42.001],[-124.226,42.001],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.002],[-124.226,42.003],[-124.226,42.003],[-124.226,42.003],[-124.226,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.225,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.224,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.223,42.003],[-124.222,42.003],[-124.222,42.003],[-124.222,42.003],[-124.222,42.003],[-124.222,42.003],[-124.222,42.003],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.002],[-124.222,42.001],[-124.222,42.001],[-124.222,42.001],[-124.222,42.001],[-124.222,42.001],[-124.222,42.001],[-124.222,42.001],[-124.222,42.001],[-124.222,42.001],[-124.222,42.001],[-124.222,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42.001],[-124.223,42],[-124.223,42],[-124.223,42],[-124.224,42],[-124.224,42],[-124.224,42],[-124.224,42],[-124.224,42]]]}},{"id":"20069","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.239,42.01],[-124.239,42.01],[-124.239,42.01],[-124.239,42.01],[-124.239,42.01],[-124.239,42.01],[-124.239,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.24,42.01],[-124.241,42.01],[-124.241,42.01],[-124.241,42.01],[-124.241,42.01],[-124.241,42.01],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.011],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.012],[-124.241,42.013],[-124.241,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.24,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.239,42.013],[-124.238,42.013],[-124.238,42.013],[-124.238,42.013],[-124.238,42.013],[-124.238,42.013],[-124.238,42.013],[-124.238,42.013],[-124.238,42.013],[-124.238,42.013],[-124.238,42.013],[-124.238,42.013],[-124.238,42.013],[-124.238,42.012],[-124.238,42.012],[-124.238,42.012],[-124.238,42.012],[-124.238,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.012],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.237,42.011],[-124.238,42.011],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.238,42.01],[-124.239,42.01],[-124.239,42.01],[-124.239,42.01],[-124.239,42.01],[-124.239,42.01],[-124.239,42.01],[-124.239,42.01]]]}},{"id":"20074","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.329,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.075],[-124.33,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.331,42.076],[-124.33,42.076],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.33,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.077],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.329,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.078],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.328,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.327,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.077],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.076],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.326,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.327,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075],[-124.328,42.075]]]}},{"id":"20078","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.079],[-124.344,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.08],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.345,42.081],[-124.344,42.081],[-124.344,42.081],[-124.344,42.081],[-124.344,42.081],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.344,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.343,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.082],[-124.342,42.081],[-124.342,42.081],[-124.342,42.081],[-124.342,42.081],[-124.342,42.081],[-124.342,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.081],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.341,42.08],[-124.342,42.08],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.342,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079],[-124.343,42.079]]]}},{"id":"20080","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.357,42.096],[-124.358,42.096],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.097],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.358,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.098],[-124.357,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.356,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.355,42.099],[-124.354,42.099],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.098],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.097],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.354,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.355,42.096],[-124.356,42.096],[-124.356,42.096]]]}},{"id":"20082","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.368,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.118],[-124.369,42.119],[-124.369,42.119],[-124.369,42.119],[-124.369,42.119],[-124.37,42.119],[-124.37,42.119],[-124.37,42.119],[-124.37,42.119],[-124.37,42.119],[-124.37,42.119],[-124.37,42.119],[-124.37,42.119],[-124.37,42.119],[-124.369,42.119],[-124.369,42.119],[-124.369,42.119],[-124.369,42.119],[-124.369,42.119],[-124.369,42.119],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.369,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.368,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.367,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.12],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.119],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.366,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.367,42.118],[-124.368,42.118]]]}},{"id":"20086","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.477,42.73],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.477,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.731],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.732],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.478,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.733],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.734],[-124.479,42.735],[-124.479,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.478,42.735],[-124.477,42.735],[-124.477,42.735],[-124.477,42.735],[-124.476,42.734],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.733],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.732],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.474,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.731],[-124.475,42.73],[-124.475,42.73],[-124.475,42.73],[-124.475,42.73],[-124.475,42.73],[-124.475,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73],[-124.476,42.73]]]}},{"id":"20093","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.475,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.701],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.702],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.476,42.703],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.475,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.474,42.704],[-124.473,42.704],[-124.473,42.704],[-124.473,42.704],[-124.473,42.704],[-124.473,42.704],[-124.473,42.704],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.473,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.703],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.472,42.702],[-124.473,42.702],[-124.473,42.702],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.473,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701],[-124.474,42.701]]]}},{"id":"20099","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.606,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.607,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.766],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.767],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.608,42.768],[-124.607,42.768],[-124.607,42.768],[-124.607,42.768],[-124.607,42.768],[-124.607,42.768],[-124.607,42.768],[-124.607,42.768],[-124.607,42.768],[-124.607,42.768],[-124.607,42.768],[-124.607,42.769],[-124.607,42.769],[-124.607,42.769],[-124.606,42.769],[-124.606,42.769],[-124.606,42.769],[-124.606,42.769],[-124.606,42.769],[-124.606,42.768],[-124.606,42.768],[-124.606,42.768],[-124.606,42.768],[-124.606,42.768],[-124.606,42.768],[-124.606,42.768],[-124.606,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.768],[-124.605,42.767],[-124.605,42.767],[-124.605,42.767],[-124.605,42.767],[-124.604,42.767],[-124.604,42.767],[-124.604,42.767],[-124.604,42.767],[-124.604,42.767],[-124.605,42.767],[-124.605,42.767],[-124.605,42.767],[-124.605,42.767],[-124.605,42.767],[-124.605,42.767],[-124.605,42.767],[-124.605,42.767],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.605,42.766],[-124.606,42.766],[-124.606,42.766],[-124.606,42.766],[-124.606,42.766],[-124.606,42.766],[-124.606,42.766],[-124.606,42.766],[-124.606,42.766],[-124.606,42.766],[-124.606,42.766],[-124.606,42.766],[-124.606,42.766]]]}},{"id":"20103","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.597,42.773],[-124.597,42.773],[-124.597,42.773],[-124.597,42.773],[-124.597,42.773],[-124.598,42.773],[-124.598,42.773],[-124.598,42.773],[-124.598,42.773],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.598,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.774],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.775],[-124.599,42.776],[-124.599,42.776],[-124.599,42.776],[-124.599,42.776],[-124.599,42.776],[-124.599,42.776],[-124.599,42.776],[-124.599,42.776],[-124.599,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.598,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.597,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.776],[-124.596,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.775],[-124.595,42.774],[-124.595,42.774],[-124.595,42.774],[-124.595,42.774],[-124.595,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.596,42.774],[-124.597,42.774],[-124.597,42.774],[-124.597,42.773],[-124.597,42.773],[-124.597,42.773],[-124.597,42.773],[-124.597,42.773],[-124.597,42.773]]]}},{"id":"20105","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.479,42.7],[-124.479,42.7],[-124.479,42.7],[-124.479,42.7],[-124.479,42.7],[-124.479,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.48,42.7],[-124.481,42.7],[-124.481,42.7],[-124.481,42.7],[-124.481,42.7],[-124.481,42.7],[-124.481,42.7],[-124.481,42.7],[-124.481,42.7],[-124.481,42.7],[-124.481,42.7],[-124.481,42.7],[-124.481,42.7],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.701],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.481,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.702],[-124.48,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.479,42.703],[-124.478,42.703],[-124.478,42.703],[-124.478,42.703],[-124.478,42.703],[-124.478,42.702],[-124.478,42.702],[-124.478,42.702],[-124.478,42.702],[-124.478,42.702],[-124.478,42.702],[-124.478,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.702],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.701],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.477,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.478,42.7],[-124.479,42.7],[-124.479,42.7],[-124.479,42.7],[-124.479,42.7],[-124.479,42.7],[-124.479,42.7]]]}},{"id":"20107","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.59,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.591,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.788],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.789],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.592,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.79],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.591,42.791],[-124.59,42.791],[-124.59,42.791],[-124.59,42.791],[-124.59,42.791],[-124.59,42.791],[-124.59,42.791],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.59,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.79],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.789],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.589,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788],[-124.59,42.788]]]}},{"id":"20109","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.584,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.822],[-124.585,42.823],[-124.585,42.823],[-124.585,42.823],[-124.585,42.823],[-124.585,42.823],[-124.585,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.823],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.824],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.586,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.585,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.584,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.583,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.825],[-124.582,42.824],[-124.582,42.824],[-124.582,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.824],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.581,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.823],[-124.582,42.822],[-124.582,42.822],[-124.582,42.822],[-124.582,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822],[-124.583,42.822]]]}},{"id":"20114","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.614,42.801],[-124.614,42.801],[-124.614,42.801],[-124.614,42.801],[-124.614,42.801],[-124.614,42.801],[-124.614,42.801],[-124.614,42.801],[-124.614,42.801],[-124.614,42.801],[-124.614,42.801],[-124.614,42.802],[-124.614,42.802],[-124.614,42.802],[-124.614,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.802],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.615,42.803],[-124.614,42.803],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.614,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.613,42.804],[-124.612,42.804],[-124.612,42.804],[-124.612,42.804],[-124.612,42.804],[-124.612,42.804],[-124.612,42.804],[-124.612,42.804],[-124.612,42.804],[-124.612,42.804],[-124.612,42.804],[-124.612,42.804],[-124.612,42.804],[-124.611,42.804],[-124.611,42.804],[-124.611,42.804],[-124.611,42.804],[-124.611,42.804],[-124.611,42.804],[-124.611,42.804],[-124.611,42.804],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.803],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.802],[-124.611,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.612,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801],[-124.613,42.801]]]}},{"id":"20120","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.549,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.846],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.847],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.55,42.848],[-124.549,42.848],[-124.549,42.848],[-124.549,42.848],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.849],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.549,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.548,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.547,42.85],[-124.546,42.85],[-124.546,42.85],[-124.546,42.85],[-124.546,42.85],[-124.547,42.849],[-124.548,42.848],[-124.548,42.848],[-124.549,42.847],[-124.549,42.846]]]}},{"id":"20124","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.435,43.082],[-124.435,43.081],[-124.436,43.079],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.436,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.437,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.438,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.078],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.439,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.079],[-124.44,43.08],[-124.44,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.08],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.441,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.081],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.44,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.439,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.438,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.437,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.436,43.082],[-124.435,43.082],[-124.435,43.082],[-124.435,43.082],[-124.435,43.082],[-124.435,43.082]]]}},{"id":"20131","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.457,43.112],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.457,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.113],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.114],[-124.458,43.115],[-124.458,43.115],[-124.458,43.115],[-124.458,43.115],[-124.458,43.115],[-124.458,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.457,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.456,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.455,43.115],[-124.454,43.115],[-124.454,43.115],[-124.454,43.115],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.114],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.454,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.455,43.113],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112],[-124.456,43.112]]]}},{"id":"20133","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.113,44.225],[-124.114,44.225],[-124.114,44.225],[-124.114,44.225],[-124.114,44.225],[-124.114,44.225],[-124.114,44.225],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.226],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.114,44.227],[-124.115,44.227],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.114,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.228],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.229],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.115,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.114,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.23],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.23],[-124.112,44.23],[-124.112,44.23],[-124.112,44.23],[-124.112,44.229],[-124.112,44.228],[-124.112,44.228],[-124.112,44.228],[-124.112,44.227],[-124.112,44.227],[-124.112,44.227],[-124.112,44.226],[-124.111,44.226],[-124.111,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225],[-124.112,44.225]]]}},{"id":"20149","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.231],[-124.113,44.232],[-124.113,44.232],[-124.113,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.232],[-124.114,44.233],[-124.114,44.233],[-124.114,44.233],[-124.114,44.233],[-124.114,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.113,44.233],[-124.112,44.233],[-124.112,44.234],[-124.112,44.234],[-124.112,44.234],[-124.112,44.234],[-124.112,44.234],[-124.112,44.234],[-124.112,44.234],[-124.112,44.234],[-124.112,44.234],[-124.112,44.234],[-124.112,44.234],[-124.111,44.234],[-124.111,44.234],[-124.111,44.234],[-124.111,44.234],[-124.111,44.234],[-124.112,44.232],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231],[-124.112,44.231]]]}},{"id":"20151","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.326],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.327],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.328],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.105,44.329],[-124.104,44.329],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.104,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.331],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.103,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.332],[-124.102,44.333],[-124.102,44.333],[-124.102,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.333],[-124.101,44.332],[-124.101,44.332],[-124.101,44.332],[-124.101,44.331],[-124.101,44.331],[-124.101,44.331],[-124.101,44.33],[-124.102,44.33],[-124.102,44.33],[-124.102,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.103,44.33],[-124.102,44.329],[-124.102,44.329],[-124.103,44.329],[-124.103,44.328],[-124.103,44.328],[-124.103,44.328],[-124.104,44.327],[-124.104,44.327],[-124.104,44.327],[-124.104,44.327],[-124.104,44.326],[-124.104,44.326]]]}},{"id":"20155","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.07,44.73],[-124.07,44.73],[-124.07,44.73],[-124.07,44.73],[-124.071,44.73],[-124.071,44.73],[-124.071,44.73],[-124.071,44.73],[-124.071,44.73],[-124.071,44.73],[-124.071,44.73],[-124.071,44.73],[-124.071,44.731],[-124.071,44.731],[-124.071,44.731],[-124.071,44.731],[-124.071,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.731],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.732],[-124.072,44.733],[-124.072,44.733],[-124.072,44.733],[-124.073,44.733],[-124.073,44.733],[-124.073,44.733],[-124.073,44.733],[-124.073,44.733],[-124.073,44.733],[-124.073,44.733],[-124.073,44.733],[-124.073,44.733],[-124.072,44.733],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.734],[-124.072,44.735],[-124.072,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.071,44.735],[-124.07,44.735],[-124.07,44.735],[-124.07,44.735],[-124.07,44.735],[-124.07,44.735],[-124.07,44.735],[-124.07,44.735],[-124.07,44.735],[-124.07,44.735],[-124.07,44.735],[-124.07,44.735],[-124.07,44.735],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.069,44.734],[-124.068,44.734],[-124.068,44.734],[-124.068,44.734],[-124.068,44.734],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.733],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.732],[-124.068,44.731],[-124.068,44.731],[-124.068,44.731],[-124.068,44.731],[-124.068,44.731],[-124.068,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.731],[-124.069,44.73],[-124.07,44.73],[-124.07,44.73],[-124.07,44.73],[-124.07,44.73],[-124.07,44.73],[-124.07,44.73],[-124.07,44.73],[-124.07,44.73],[-124.07,44.73]]]}},{"id":"20167","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.073,44.787],[-124.073,44.787],[-124.073,44.787],[-124.073,44.787],[-124.073,44.787],[-124.073,44.787],[-124.074,44.787],[-124.074,44.787],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.074,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.788],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.789],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.79],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.791],[-124.075,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.073,44.792],[-124.073,44.792],[-124.073,44.792],[-124.073,44.792],[-124.073,44.792],[-124.073,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.792],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.793],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.074,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.073,44.794],[-124.072,44.794],[-124.072,44.794],[-124.072,44.793],[-124.072,44.793],[-124.072,44.793],[-124.072,44.793],[-124.072,44.792],[-124.072,44.792],[-124.072,44.792],[-124.072,44.792],[-124.073,44.791],[-124.073,44.791],[-124.073,44.79],[-124.073,44.79],[-124.073,44.79],[-124.073,44.789],[-124.073,44.789],[-124.073,44.788],[-124.073,44.788],[-124.073,44.787],[-124.073,44.787]]]}},{"id":"20175","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.025,44.951],[-124.025,44.951],[-124.025,44.951],[-124.025,44.951],[-124.025,44.951],[-124.025,44.951],[-124.025,44.951],[-124.025,44.951],[-124.025,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.951],[-124.024,44.95],[-124.024,44.95],[-124.024,44.95],[-124.023,44.95],[-124.023,44.95],[-124.024,44.95],[-124.024,44.949],[-124.024,44.949],[-124.024,44.949],[-124.024,44.949],[-124.024,44.948],[-124.024,44.948],[-124.024,44.948],[-124.024,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.025,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.948],[-124.026,44.949],[-124.026,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.027,44.949],[-124.028,44.949],[-124.028,44.949],[-124.028,44.949],[-124.028,44.949],[-124.028,44.949],[-124.028,44.949],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.028,44.95],[-124.027,44.95],[-124.027,44.95],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.027,44.951],[-124.026,44.951],[-124.026,44.951],[-124.026,44.951],[-124.026,44.951],[-124.026,44.951],[-124.026,44.951],[-124.026,44.951],[-124.026,44.951],[-124.026,44.951],[-124.026,44.951],[-124.026,44.951],[-124.026,44.951],[-124.025,44.951],[-124.025,44.951],[-124.025,44.951],[-124.025,44.951],[-124.025,44.951]]]}},{"id":"20184","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.021,45.025],[-124.022,45.025],[-124.022,45.025],[-124.022,45.025],[-124.022,45.025],[-124.022,45.025],[-124.022,45.025],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.022,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.026],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.023,45.027],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.022,45.028],[-124.021,45.028],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.021,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.02,45.029],[-124.019,45.029],[-124.019,45.029],[-124.019,45.029],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.019,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.028],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.027],[-124.018,45.026],[-124.018,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.026],[-124.019,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.02,45.025],[-124.021,45.025]]]}},{"id":"20188","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.505],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.094,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.506],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.095,44.507],[-124.094,44.507],[-124.094,44.507],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.508],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.094,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.093,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.092,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.091,44.509],[-124.09,44.509],[-124.09,44.509],[-124.09,44.509],[-124.09,44.509],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.508],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.09,44.507],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.091,44.506],[-124.092,44.506],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.092,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505],[-124.093,44.505]]]}},{"id":"20194","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.222],[-123.974,45.222],[-123.975,45.222],[-123.976,45.223],[-123.976,45.222],[-123.976,45.222],[-123.976,45.222],[-123.977,45.221],[-123.978,45.221],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.977,45.22],[-123.977,45.221],[-123.977,45.221],[-123.977,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.978,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.22],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.221],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.979,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.222],[-123.98,45.223],[-123.98,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.223],[-123.979,45.224],[-123.979,45.224],[-123.979,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.224],[-123.978,45.225],[-123.978,45.225],[-123.978,45.225],[-123.978,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.977,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.976,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.225],[-123.975,45.224],[-123.975,45.224],[-123.975,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224],[-123.974,45.224]]]}},{"id":"20199","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.338],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.978,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.979,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.98,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.981,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.982,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.337],[-123.983,45.336],[-123.983,45.336],[-123.983,45.336],[-123.983,45.336],[-123.983,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.984,45.336],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.985,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.986,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.987,45.337],[-123.988,45.337],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.988,45.338],[-123.987,45.339],[-123.986,45.338],[-123.985,45.338],[-123.983,45.339],[-123.981,45.339],[-123.98,45.339],[-123.979,45.339],[-123.978,45.339],[-123.978,45.339],[-123.978,45.339],[-123.978,45.339],[-123.977,45.339],[-123.977,45.339],[-123.977,45.338],[-123.977,45.338]]]}},{"id":"20201","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.974,45.484],[-123.973,45.484],[-123.973,45.484],[-123.973,45.484],[-123.972,45.483],[-123.973,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.973,45.482],[-123.973,45.482],[-123.973,45.482],[-123.972,45.482],[-123.971,45.482],[-123.97,45.482],[-123.97,45.482],[-123.97,45.481],[-123.97,45.48],[-123.97,45.479],[-123.97,45.479],[-123.969,45.479],[-123.969,45.479],[-123.969,45.479],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.97,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.971,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.972,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.478],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.479],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.48],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.973,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.481],[-123.974,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.482],[-123.975,45.483],[-123.975,45.483],[-123.975,45.483],[-123.975,45.483],[-123.975,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.483],[-123.974,45.484],[-123.974,45.484],[-123.974,45.484],[-123.974,45.484],[-123.974,45.484]]]}},{"id":"20208","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.494],[-123.986,45.495],[-123.986,45.495],[-123.986,45.495],[-123.986,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.495],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.496],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.987,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.986,45.497],[-123.985,45.497],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.985,45.498],[-123.984,45.498],[-123.984,45.498],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.984,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.983,45.497],[-123.982,45.497],[-123.982,45.497],[-123.982,45.497],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.496],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.982,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.495],[-123.983,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.984,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494],[-123.985,45.494]]]}},{"id":"20211","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.969,45.804],[-123.969,45.804],[-123.969,45.804],[-123.969,45.804],[-123.969,45.804],[-123.969,45.804],[-123.968,45.804],[-123.968,45.804],[-123.968,45.804],[-123.968,45.804],[-123.968,45.804],[-123.968,45.804],[-123.968,45.804],[-123.968,45.804],[-123.968,45.804],[-123.968,45.804],[-123.968,45.804],[-123.968,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.804],[-123.967,45.803],[-123.967,45.803],[-123.967,45.803],[-123.967,45.803],[-123.969,45.803],[-123.969,45.803],[-123.969,45.802],[-123.969,45.802],[-123.968,45.801],[-123.968,45.8],[-123.968,45.798],[-123.968,45.798],[-123.968,45.798],[-123.968,45.798],[-123.968,45.798],[-123.968,45.798],[-123.968,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.969,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.799],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.8],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.97,45.801],[-123.971,45.801],[-123.971,45.801],[-123.971,45.801],[-123.971,45.801],[-123.971,45.801],[-123.971,45.801],[-123.971,45.801],[-123.971,45.801],[-123.971,45.802],[-123.971,45.802],[-123.971,45.802],[-123.971,45.802],[-123.971,45.802],[-123.971,45.802],[-123.971,45.802],[-123.971,45.802],[-123.971,45.802],[-123.971,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.802],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.803],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.972,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.971,45.804],[-123.97,45.804],[-123.97,45.804],[-123.97,45.804],[-123.97,45.804],[-123.97,45.804],[-123.97,45.804],[-123.97,45.804],[-123.97,45.804],[-123.97,45.804],[-123.97,45.804],[-123.97,45.804],[-123.969,45.804],[-123.969,45.804],[-123.969,45.804],[-123.969,45.804],[-123.969,45.804],[-123.969,45.804],[-123.969,45.804]]]}},{"id":"20215","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.962,45.834],[-123.962,45.833],[-123.962,45.833],[-123.962,45.833],[-123.962,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.833],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.963,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.834],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.963,45.835],[-123.963,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.835],[-123.964,45.836],[-123.964,45.836],[-123.964,45.836],[-123.964,45.836],[-123.964,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.836],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.837],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.838],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.963,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.839],[-123.962,45.838],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.837],[-123.962,45.836],[-123.962,45.835],[-123.962,45.834]]]}},{"id":"20226","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.974,45.959],[-123.974,45.959],[-123.974,45.959],[-123.974,45.959],[-123.974,45.959],[-123.974,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.975,45.959],[-123.976,45.959],[-123.976,45.959],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.96],[-123.976,45.961],[-123.976,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.961],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.962],[-123.977,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.963],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.976,45.964],[-123.975,45.964],[-123.975,45.964],[-123.975,45.964],[-123.975,45.964],[-123.975,45.964],[-123.975,45.964],[-123.975,45.964],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.965],[-123.975,45.966],[-123.975,45.966],[-123.975,45.966],[-123.975,45.966],[-123.975,45.966],[-123.975,45.966],[-123.975,45.966],[-123.975,45.966],[-123.975,45.966],[-123.974,45.966],[-123.974,45.966],[-123.974,45.966],[-123.974,45.966],[-123.974,45.966],[-123.974,45.966],[-123.974,45.966],[-123.974,45.966],[-123.974,45.966],[-123.974,45.966],[-123.974,45.966],[-123.974,45.966],[-123.974,45.967],[-123.974,45.967],[-123.974,45.967],[-123.974,45.967],[-123.974,45.967],[-123.974,45.967],[-123.974,45.967],[-123.973,45.967],[-123.973,45.967],[-123.973,45.967],[-123.973,45.967],[-123.973,45.967],[-123.973,45.967],[-123.973,45.967],[-123.973,45.967],[-123.973,45.967],[-123.973,45.967],[-123.973,45.967],[-123.973,45.967],[-123.972,45.967],[-123.972,45.967],[-123.973,45.964],[-123.974,45.963],[-123.974,45.963],[-123.975,45.962],[-123.975,45.961],[-123.974,45.961],[-123.974,45.959],[-123.974,45.959],[-123.974,45.959],[-123.974,45.959]]]}},{"id":"20230","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.982,46.177],[-123.983,46.177],[-123.983,46.177],[-123.983,46.177],[-123.983,46.177],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.178],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.983,46.179],[-123.982,46.179],[-123.982,46.179],[-123.982,46.179],[-123.982,46.179],[-123.982,46.179],[-123.982,46.18],[-123.982,46.18],[-123.982,46.18],[-123.982,46.18],[-123.982,46.18],[-123.982,46.18],[-123.982,46.18],[-123.982,46.18],[-123.982,46.18],[-123.982,46.18],[-123.982,46.18],[-123.981,46.18],[-123.981,46.18],[-123.981,46.18],[-123.981,46.18],[-123.981,46.18],[-123.981,46.18],[-123.981,46.18],[-123.981,46.18],[-123.981,46.18],[-123.98,46.179],[-123.979,46.178],[-123.979,46.178],[-123.979,46.178],[-123.979,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.98,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177],[-123.981,46.177]]]}},{"id":"20232","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.453,42.691],[-124.453,42.691],[-124.453,42.691],[-124.453,42.691],[-124.453,42.691],[-124.453,42.691],[-124.453,42.691],[-124.453,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.454,42.691],[-124.455,42.691],[-124.455,42.691],[-124.455,42.691],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.455,42.692],[-124.456,42.692],[-124.456,42.692],[-124.456,42.692],[-124.456,42.692],[-124.456,42.692],[-124.456,42.692],[-124.456,42.692],[-124.456,42.692],[-124.456,42.692],[-124.456,42.692],[-124.456,42.692],[-124.456,42.692],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.456,42.693],[-124.457,42.693],[-124.457,42.693],[-124.457,42.693],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.694],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.695],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.457,42.696],[-124.456,42.696],[-124.456,42.696],[-124.456,42.696],[-124.456,42.696],[-124.456,42.696],[-124.456,42.697],[-124.456,42.697],[-124.456,42.697],[-124.456,42.697],[-124.456,42.697],[-124.456,42.697],[-124.456,42.697],[-124.456,42.697],[-124.456,42.697],[-124.455,42.697],[-124.455,42.697],[-124.455,42.697],[-124.455,42.697],[-124.455,42.697],[-124.455,42.697],[-124.455,42.697],[-124.455,42.697],[-124.455,42.697],[-124.455,42.697],[-124.455,42.696],[-124.455,42.694],[-124.455,42.694],[-124.454,42.693],[-124.454,42.693],[-124.453,42.692],[-124.453,42.692],[-124.451,42.692],[-124.451,42.692],[-124.451,42.692],[-124.451,42.692],[-124.451,42.692],[-124.451,42.692],[-124.451,42.691],[-124.451,42.691],[-124.451,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.452,42.691],[-124.453,42.691],[-124.453,42.691],[-124.453,42.691],[-124.453,42.691],[-124.453,42.691],[-124.453,42.691]]]}},{"id":"20238","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.388,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.389,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.39,42.209],[-124.391,42.209],[-124.391,42.209],[-124.391,42.209],[-124.391,42.209],[-124.391,42.209],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.391,42.21],[-124.392,42.21],[-124.392,42.21],[-124.392,42.21],[-124.392,42.21],[-124.392,42.21],[-124.392,42.21],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.211],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.392,42.212],[-124.391,42.212],[-124.391,42.212],[-124.391,42.212],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.391,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.39,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.213],[-124.389,42.212],[-124.389,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.388,42.212],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.387,42.211],[-124.386,42.211],[-124.386,42.211],[-124.386,42.211],[-124.386,42.211],[-124.386,42.211],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.21],[-124.386,42.209],[-124.386,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209],[-124.387,42.209]]]}},{"id":"20240","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.418,42.23],[-124.418,42.23],[-124.418,42.23],[-124.418,42.23],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.418,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.231],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.232],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.419,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.418,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.234],[-124.417,42.234],[-124.417,42.234],[-124.417,42.234],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.417,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.416,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.233],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.232],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.415,42.231],[-124.416,42.231],[-124.416,42.231],[-124.416,42.231],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.416,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23],[-124.417,42.23]]]}},{"id":"20245","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.397,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.237],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.238],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.399,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.239],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.398,42.24],[-124.397,42.24],[-124.397,42.239],[-124.396,42.239],[-124.396,42.238],[-124.395,42.238],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.395,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237],[-124.396,42.237]]]}},{"id":"20247","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.433,42.454],[-124.433,42.454],[-124.433,42.454],[-124.434,42.454],[-124.434,42.454],[-124.434,42.454],[-124.434,42.454],[-124.434,42.454],[-124.434,42.454],[-124.434,42.454],[-124.434,42.454],[-124.434,42.454],[-124.434,42.454],[-124.434,42.454],[-124.434,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.454],[-124.435,42.455],[-124.435,42.455],[-124.435,42.455],[-124.435,42.455],[-124.435,42.455],[-124.435,42.455],[-124.435,42.455],[-124.435,42.455],[-124.435,42.455],[-124.436,42.455],[-124.436,42.455],[-124.436,42.455],[-124.436,42.455],[-124.436,42.455],[-124.436,42.455],[-124.436,42.455],[-124.436,42.455],[-124.436,42.455],[-124.436,42.455],[-124.436,42.455],[-124.436,42.455],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.434,42.457],[-124.433,42.457],[-124.433,42.457],[-124.433,42.457],[-124.433,42.457],[-124.433,42.457],[-124.433,42.457],[-124.433,42.457],[-124.433,42.457],[-124.433,42.457],[-124.433,42.457],[-124.433,42.457],[-124.433,42.456],[-124.433,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.432,42.456],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.431,42.455],[-124.432,42.455],[-124.432,42.455],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.432,42.454],[-124.433,42.454],[-124.433,42.454],[-124.433,42.454],[-124.433,42.454],[-124.433,42.454],[-124.433,42.454],[-124.433,42.454],[-124.433,42.454],[-124.433,42.454],[-124.433,42.454],[-124.433,42.454]]]}},{"id":"20251","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.42,42.314],[-124.421,42.314],[-124.421,42.314],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.315],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.316],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.421,42.317],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.42,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.419,42.318],[-124.418,42.318],[-124.418,42.318],[-124.418,42.318],[-124.418,42.318],[-124.418,42.318],[-124.418,42.317],[-124.418,42.317],[-124.418,42.316],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.315],[-124.417,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.418,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314],[-124.419,42.314]]]}},{"id":"20254","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.427,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.386],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.387],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.428,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.427,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.426,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.388],[-124.425,42.387],[-124.425,42.387],[-124.425,42.387],[-124.424,42.387],[-124.424,42.387],[-124.424,42.386],[-124.424,42.386],[-124.424,42.386],[-124.424,42.386],[-124.424,42.386],[-124.424,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.425,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386],[-124.426,42.386]]]}},{"id":"20260","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.43,42.449],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.447],[-124.431,42.446],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.432,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.433,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.445],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.434,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.446],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.435,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.447],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.434,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.448],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.449],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.433,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.45],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.432,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.431,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.43,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.429,42.451],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.428,42.45],[-124.429,42.449],[-124.43,42.449]]]}},{"id":"20263","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission;

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.438,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.456],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.457],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.439,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.438,42.458],[-124.437,42.458],[-124.437,42.458],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.437,42.459],[-124.436,42.459],[-124.436,42.459],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.436,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.458],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.457],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.435,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.436,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456],[-124.437,42.456]]]}},{"id":"20269","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.437,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.46],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.461],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.438,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.437,42.462],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.463],[-124.436,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.435,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.462],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.461],[-124.434,42.46],[-124.434,42.46],[-124.434,42.46],[-124.434,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.435,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46],[-124.436,42.46]]]}},{"id":"20271","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.464],[-124.499,42.464],[-124.499,42.464],[-124.499,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.498,42.464],[-124.497,42.464],[-124.497,42.464],[-124.497,42.464],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.497,42.463],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.498,42.462],[-124.499,42.462],[-124.499,42.462],[-124.499,42.462],[-124.499,42.462],[-124.499,42.462],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.499,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.5,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.501,42.461],[-124.502,42.461],[-124.502,42.461],[-124.502,42.461],[-124.502,42.461],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.502,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.462],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.503,42.463],[-124.502,42.463],[-124.502,42.463],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.502,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.501,42.464],[-124.5,42.464],[-124.5,42.464],[-124.5,42.464],[-124.5,42.464],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.5,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465],[-124.499,42.465]]]}},{"id":"20273","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.417,42.504],[-124.417,42.504],[-124.417,42.504],[-124.417,42.504],[-124.417,42.504],[-124.417,42.504],[-124.417,42.504],[-124.417,42.504],[-124.417,42.504],[-124.417,42.504],[-124.417,42.504],[-124.417,42.504],[-124.417,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.504],[-124.418,42.505],[-124.418,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.419,42.505],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.418,42.506],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.417,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.416,42.507],[-124.415,42.507],[-124.415,42.507],[-124.415,42.507],[-124.415,42.507],[-124.415,42.507],[-124.415,42.507],[-124.415,42.507],[-124.415,42.507],[-124.415,42.507],[-124.415,42.506],[-124.416,42.505],[-124.417,42.504]]]}},{"id":"20281","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.572],[-124.391,42.572],[-124.391,42.572],[-124.391,42.572],[-124.391,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.572],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.571],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.39,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.391,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.392,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.393,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.394,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.57],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.396,42.571],[-124.396,42.571],[-124.396,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.571],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.395,42.572],[-124.394,42.572],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.394,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.393,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.392,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573],[-124.391,42.573]]]}},{"id":"20285","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.412,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.583],[-124.413,42.584],[-124.413,42.584],[-124.413,42.584],[-124.413,42.584],[-124.413,42.584],[-124.413,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.584],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.585],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.414,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.413,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.412,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.411,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.586],[-124.41,42.585],[-124.41,42.585],[-124.41,42.585],[-124.41,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.585],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.584],[-124.409,42.583],[-124.409,42.583],[-124.409,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.41,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583],[-124.411,42.583]]]}},{"id":"20287","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.402,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.403,42.619],[-124.404,42.619],[-124.404,42.619],[-124.404,42.619],[-124.404,42.619],[-124.404,42.619],[-124.404,42.619],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.404,42.62],[-124.405,42.62],[-124.405,42.62],[-124.405,42.62],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.405,42.621],[-124.404,42.621],[-124.404,42.621],[-124.404,42.621],[-124.404,42.621],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.622],[-124.404,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.403,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.402,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.623],[-124.401,42.622],[-124.401,42.622],[-124.402,42.621],[-124.402,42.62],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.4,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619],[-124.401,42.619]]]}},{"id":"20290","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge was established as a refuge as well as a breeding ground for seabirds and marine mammals. The scenic and rugged site includes 1,853 rocks, reefs, and islands - all of the rocks and islands of the refuge are designated National Wilderness Areas, with the exception of 1-acre Tillamook Rock. Most of Oregon's estimated 1.2 million seabirds use Oregon Islands Refuge as a place to raise their young, and the state's seals and sea lions use the islands as a place to haulout or to give birth to their pups. Additionally, the refuge protects two headlands, Coquille Point and Crook Point, and a 14-acre parcel of land next to Whale Cove Habitat Refuge.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For more information and latest updates, please see the \"Latest Newsletters\"\u001d and \"Refuge Updates\"\u001d provided on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/refuges\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Wildlife Refuges page<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>Oregon State Police dispatch: 1-800-452-7888<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-124.434,42.67],[-124.433,42.67],[-124.432,42.669],[-124.432,42.669],[-124.432,42.669],[-124.432,42.669],[-124.432,42.669],[-124.432,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.433,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.434,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.435,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.436,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.437,42.669],[-124.438,42.669],[-124.438,42.669],[-124.438,42.669],[-124.438,42.669],[-124.438,42.669],[-124.438,42.669],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.438,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.439,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.44,42.67],[-124.441,42.67],[-124.441,42.67],[-124.441,42.67],[-124.441,42.67],[-124.441,42.67],[-124.441,42.67],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.671],[-124.441,42.672],[-124.441,42.672],[-124.441,42.672],[-124.441,42.672],[-124.441,42.672],[-124.44,42.672],[-124.439,42.671],[-124.437,42.671],[-124.435,42.67],[-124.435,42.67],[-124.435,42.67],[-124.434,42.67]]]}},{"id":"20293","type":"SMA","name":"Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"3300CCFF","lineColor":"FF00CCFF","information":"<b>Fishing Heavily Restricted<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>1.

extraordinarily high diversity of marine life, including rocky reef species, intertidal invertebrates, seabird colonies and marine mammals. The reefs are home to more than 700 species of invertebrates, as well as 120 fish species, marine plants, seabirds, and marine mammals. The area boasts remarkably clear water, underwater pinnacles, and some of the shallowest coldwater corals on the Central Coast. This MPA supports thriving species, while also helping to restore endangered or threatened marine life and is expected to have spillover benefits to adjacent fished areas.<\/p><b>More

This MPA supports thriving species, while also helping to restore endangered or threatened marine life and is expected to have spillover benefits to adjacent fished areas.<\/p><b>More Information:<\/b><p>For the latest fishing regulation information:<br>Call or drop by your local Marine Region CDFW office.<br>In season changes to commercial and recreational fishing regulations: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dfg.ca.gov\/marine\/inseason2015.asp\" target=\"_blank\" >http:\/\/www.dfg.ca.gov\/marine\/inseason2015.asp<\/a><br>Sport Fishing: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dfg.ca.gov\/marine\/fishing_map.asp\" target=\"_blank\" >DFG Sportfishing Regulations<\/a><br>Groundfish fishing regulations: (831) 649-2801<br>Ocean salmon fishing regulations: (707) 576-3429<br>CDFW News Room at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wildlife.ca.gov\/news\" target=\"_blank\" >CDFW News<\/a><br>Marine Region News Page at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dfg.ca.gov\/marine\/news.asp\" target=\"_blank\" >Marine News<\/a><br>Marine Region News Service (email notification of ocean-related news) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dfg.ca.gov\/marine\/subscribe.asp\" target=\"_blank\" >Marine Email Subscription<\/a><br>For all questions, contact the CDFW Marine Region Headquarters: (831) 649-2870, <a href=\"mailto:AskMarine@wildlife.ca.gov\">AskMarine@wildlife.ca.gov<\/a><\/p><b>Report Violations:<\/b><p>CalTIP 1 (888) 334-2258<\/p><b>MPA Information Provided By <a href=\"https:\/\/mpa.protectedseas.net\">ProtectedSeas<\/a><\/b>","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-120.933,35.254],[-120.933,35.254],[-120.933,35.254],[-120.933,35.253],[-120.873,35.183],[-120.919,35.183],[-120.919,35.183],[-120.919,35.184],[-120.92,35.184],[-120.922,35.186],[-120.923,35.187],[-120.924,35.188],[-120.925,35.189],[-120.926,35.19],[-120.928,35.191],[-120.929,35.192],[-120.93,35.193],[-120.931,35.194],[-120.933,35.195],[-120.934,35.197],[-120.935,35.198],[-120.936,35.2],[-120.937,35.201],[-120.938,35.202],[-120.939,35.203],[-120.94,35.205],[-120.941,35.206],[-120.941,35.207],[-120.942,35.208],[-120.943,35.21],[-120.943,35.212],[-120.944,35.213],[-120.945,35.214],[-120.946,35.216],[-120.947,35.217],[-120.948,35.218],[-120.95,35.219],[-120.951,35.221],[-120.952,35.222],[-120.952,35.224],[-120.953,35.225],[-120.954,35.226],[-120.955,35.227],[-120.956,35.229],[-120.957,35.23],[-120.958,35.231],[-120.958,35.233],[-120.959,35.234],[-120.96,35.235],[-120.961,35.237],[-120.961,35.238],[-120.962,35.24],[-120.962,35.241],[-120.963,35.243],[-120.963,35.244],[-120.964,35.246],[-120.964,35.247],[-120.964,35.249],[-120.964,35.25],[-120.965,35.252],[-120.965,35.253],[-120.965,35.254],[-120.965,35.254],[-120.933,35.254]]]}},{"id":"20335","type":"SMA","name":"Vandenberg State Marine Reserve","startDate":"2000-01-01","endDate":"2100-01-01","fillColor":"33FF0000","lineColor":"FFFF0000","information":"<b>No Take Area<br><\/b><b>Managed By:<\/b> California Department of Fish and Wildlife<br>Year-round<br><br><br><b>Restricted:<\/b><p>It is unlawful to injure, damage, take, or possess any living, geological, or cultural marine resource, except under a scientific collecting permit issued by the department or with specific authorization from the commission for research, restoration, or monitoring purposes.<\/p><b>Allowed:<\/b><p>Take incidental to base operations and commercial space launch operations identified by the Vandenberg Air Force Base Commander as mission critical.<\/p><b>Purpose:<\/b><p>To protect critical habitats which lie next to Vandenberg Air Force Base and which are able to sustain a wide range of species.
